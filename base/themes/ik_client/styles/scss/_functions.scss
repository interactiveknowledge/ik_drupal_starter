/**
 * Create functions for helping us get complex values
 * 
 * Mixins are very similar to functions but the main difference between the two is
 * that mixins output lines of Sass code that will compile directly into CSS styles,
 * while functions return a value that can then become the value for a CSS property
 * or become something that might be passed to another function or mixin.
